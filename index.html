        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Amit Wats!</h1>
				<p>I'm a Google Certified Data Engineer with experience developing applications and products in the  Machine Learning space. Worked on a Machine Learning framework open source product. In addition to this working on a bespoke Machine Learning application for a major client (among the top 4 banks in Australia). Apart from this there were multiple smaller clients who I worked for in the data analysis and visualisation space. The primary technologies I worked and am proficient with are Python ( Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn), HTML5, CSS and React. Prior to this I have an additional 16 years of experience in the IT space developing and project managing traditional web based applications and technologies.<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
